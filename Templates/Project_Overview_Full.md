Perfect.
We’re going to build this as a serious, production-grade Project Overview Template.

This is:

Not marketing fluff

Not startup hype

Not brand-specific

Structured for SaaS / API / Internal Tool / Platform

AI-friendly

Investor-friendly

Engineering-friendly


This becomes one of your core Phase 1 templates inside Damn You Docs.

🧠 If We Want to Level This Up Further

We can now create:

1. AI-optimized JSON version


2. Validation schema


3. Section scoring system


4. Auto-summarizer from this into pitch deck


5. Investor-facing condensed variant


6. Technical-only variant


7. Lean startup 1-page variant



Which direction do you want to evolve this into next?
