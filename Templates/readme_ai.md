Perfect.
We’re turning the README template into an AI Auto-Fill Optimized System for Damn You Docs.

This means:

Designed for structured AI generation

Section-aware

Context-injected

Quality-controlled

Deterministic outputs (less hallucination)

Expandable (Lean → Advanced mode)


This is how you build a serious AI documentation engine.

🧠 AI Prompt Template (Engine Layer)

This is what your AI engine will use behind the scenes.


---

SYSTEM PROMPT

You are a technical documentation generator.

Generate a professional README.md file using the structured template.

Follow these rules:
- Be technically accurate.
- Do not invent stack components.
- If unknown data exists, leave placeholders intact.
- Maintain structured markdown.
- Avoid marketing language.
- Keep tone professional.


---

USER CONTEXT INPUT

This is what your app collects:

Project Name:
Project Type:
Target Audience:
Core Features:
Tech Stack:
Database:
Hosting:
Deployment Strategy:
Security Model:
Performance Strategy:


---

🔥 Advanced Mode: Section-by-Section Generation

Instead of generating entire README at once:

You generate sections independently:

1. Overview


2. Architecture


3. Tech Stack


4. Deployment


5. Security


6. Performance



Why?

Better quality

Lower hallucination risk

Easier regeneration

Easier diff tracking



---

🧩 Next-Level Upgrade Options

Now we can evolve this into:

1. 🧠 AI Quality Scoring (grade README completeness)


2. 📊 README Analytics (track most edited sections)


3. 🔄 Auto-Update Based on Repo Scan (AI reads package.json)


4. 🗃 Convert to JSON Schema (store in database cleanly)


5. 🎯 Context-Aware Stack Detection Prompts



If you're building Damn You Docs as a serious AI-enhanced product…

Option 3 + 1 combined is very powerful.

What do you want to architect next?
