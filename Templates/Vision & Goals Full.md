{{project_name}} — Vision & Goals


---

1️⃣ Long-Term Vision (3–5 Years)

Vision Statement

{{vision_statement}}

Describe the future state where the product has:

Clear market position

Mature feature ecosystem

Operational stability

Recognized authority in its domain

Sustainable growth model



---

Market Position (3–5 Years)

Target market segment:

Market penetration goal:

Competitive positioning:

Strategic advantage:



---

Product Maturity Target

Fully modular architecture

Stable API surface

Mature documentation system

Automated deployment pipeline

Integrated analytics



---

Impact

What measurable transformation does the product create?

What problem becomes obsolete?

What workflow becomes simplified?



---

2️⃣ 12-Month Vision

Product State After 12 Months

Core features fully stable

Clear onboarding path

Documented architecture

Performance benchmarks defined

Usage analytics implemented



---

Growth Targets (12 Months)

Active users:

Retention target:

Revenue target:

Conversion rate:

Feature adoption rate:



---

Infrastructure Maturity

CI/CD pipeline operational

Monitoring + logging in place

Version control enforced

Automated testing coverage baseline established



---

3️⃣ Current Phase Objectives

Phase Name

(MVP Build / Beta Refinement / Scaling / Optimization)

Active Objectives

1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 

Each objective must:

Produce measurable output

Align with 12-month vision

Respect resource constraints



---

4️⃣ Strategic Themes

Strategic themes define how decisions are made.

{{#each strategic_themes}}

{{this}} {{/each}}


Examples:

Quality over quantity

Modular architecture first

AI-assisted, not AI-dependent

Measurable outcomes only

Clear scope boundaries



---

5️⃣ Measurable Goals

All goals must be specific and time-bound.


---

Product Goals

Reduce onboarding time to under 10 minutes

Achieve >60% template usage rate

Maintain <150ms search latency

Maintain autosave under 2 seconds



---

Business Goals

Monthly recurring revenue target:

Customer acquisition cost threshold:

70%+ retention rate

NPS target:



---

Technical Goals

80% unit test coverage

<1% error rate

99.5% uptime

Versioned API documentation



---

6️⃣ Success Criteria

Define objective success thresholds:

The project is considered successful when:

Activation time < target

Core metric adoption > threshold

System stability meets SLA

Documentation completeness above defined score

Revenue covers operational costs


Success must be measurable, not emotional.


---

7️⃣ Strategic Non-Goals (Scope Boundaries)

Explicitly state what will NOT be pursued:

{{#each strategic_non_goals}}

{{this}} {{/each}}


Examples:

No marketplace in MVP

No public API until core stable

No enterprise features until usage validated

No multi-product sprawl


This protects focus.


---

8️⃣ Core Assumptions

Every strategic plan rests on assumptions.

User Assumptions

Users prefer structured templates over blank pages

Users value automation over flexibility


Technical Assumptions

Selected stack scales to expected load

Database architecture supports versioning


Business Assumptions

Users are willing to pay for quality

Market values structured documentation


All assumptions should be testable.


---

9️⃣ Risks to Vision

Market Risk

Competition from established platforms

Market fatigue


Technical Risk

Over-complex architecture

Scaling bottlenecks


Execution Risk

Feature creep

Resource overextension


Financial Risk

AI token cost overruns

Hosting expenses scaling faster than revenue



---

🔟 Alignment Check

Before each major milestone, validate:

Does this align with 3–5 year vision?

Does this support the 12-month state?

Does it respect MVP boundaries?

Does it align with strategic themes?

Does it violate any non-goals?


If misaligned → defer or remove.


---

1️⃣1️⃣ Vision Integrity Rules

1. No vague ambition.


2. No undefined metrics.


3. No expansion without validation.


4. No strategic contradiction.


5. No roadmap drift without review.




---

1️⃣2️⃣ Review Cadence

Vision should be reviewed:

Quarterly (minor adjustments)

Annually (major revision)

Post-major milestone


Version history must be tracked.


---
